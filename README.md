-- Docker Events watcher -- 
- start/stop mining with active idle job Clore / Octaspace
- main complete package in source folder
- tested with 1 gpu rigs only
- for easiest setup install ubuntu server with username user
- services assume .conf files are in /home/user/ and named rig-cpu.conf or rig-gpu.conf etc
- scripts need absolute path '/home/user/' current user reference doesnt work
- for ubuntu server 24.04 rigs I use idle job image "ubuntu:24.04" as placeholder idle job on Clore / Octaspace
- I use ubuntu server 22.04 for my AMD gpu rig, better driver/overclock compatible
- TARGET_IMAGE in cpu/gpu .conf files needs to match chosen idle job image name
- using putty ssh or similar copy/paste contents of 'install - script files.sh' into rig console and press enter to write all the script files
- copy/paste press enter contents of other install-*** conf etc files
- include api.conf if using miner api and one of the gpu-reset scripts if needed, Nvidia,AMD
- seperate script files in source/lib folder just to make easier to read
- batch files can be used to send new .conf files to a list of rigs from windows pc
- start/stop/pause idle job and watch logs to test...
- sudo journalctl -u docker_events_cpu.service -f
- sudo journalctl -u docker_events_gpu.service -f
- 'sudo journalctl -u docker_events_gpu.service -e' show more history
- ctrl+c to leave logs
- if miner isnt starting copy the actual command being run from logs to test ... command:
- 'sudo docker ps' shows current running images/containers
- miners load in a screen session by name of miner by default, or SCREEN_NAME set in cpu/gpu .conf
- sudo screen -ls to list active sessions
- sudo screen -r name to re-open/join session
- ctrl a+d to leave session with miner runnning
- ctrl c to stop miner
- exit to close screen session
- %CPU_THREADS% in args will add number of threads minus one (total -1), affinity will be added if using xmrig see 03-cpu_threads.sh in lib to customise
- see rig conf examples...
