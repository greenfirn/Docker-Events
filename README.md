-- Docker Events watcher -- 
- Clore / Octaspace / Nosana(podman) / Vast(testing cpu mining-ignore test containers)
- ** use extreme caution when using any type of custom scripts **
- ** your risking host/account being banned **
- ... start/stop mining with active idle container
- ... start/stop mining with no containers running
- ... apply/reset overclocks
- start/stop/pause idle job and watch logs to confirm all working as expected
- see source for complete package, install miners, rig configs, etc
- testing source/no-container-docker_events_monitor-vast.sh for idle cpu mining
- use 'vast' as TARGET_NAME in rig configs
- testing new nosana_monitor-1.sh and source/podman_events_monitor.sh,
- use 'podman' as TARGET_NAME in rig configs
- ... some type of short server test happens around benchmark times, maybe is confirming server specs
- ... PODMAN_IDLE_CONFIRM_LOOPS, IDLE_CONFIRMATION_THRESHOLD should be at least 4 to safely cover time between container load/unload etc
- added -retry-on-failure versions, docker events in a loop in case fails/disconnects
- 'sudo docker ps' shows current running images/containers
- follow logs: sudo journalctl -u docker_events_gpu.service -f
- show more history: sudo journalctl -u docker_events_gpu.service -e
- ctrl+c to leave logs
- nvidia gpu nvtop : sudo apt install -y nvtop
- amd gpu rocm-smi
