-- Docker Events watcher - start/stop mining when idle job active --

** meant to be used as the complete version of 'docker_events_universal.sh' from All-in-one ... so if you change miner versions in .conf the service will install that version... if you dont use %CPU_THREADS% in your .conf then auto cpu threads/affinity will not get added to the final cmd

see rig conf examples...
